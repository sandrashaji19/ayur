            <h2>Personal Care</h2>
            <div class="tip" onclick="toggleTip(this)">
                <h3>1:Apply Milk on your skin</h3>
                <p class="tip-details">When daily, dunk a cotton ball into a little bowl of raw milk and wipe your face altogether with it to eliminate dust and grime from your pores.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip" onclick="toggleTip(this)">
                <h3>2:  Use Aloe Vera On Face On A Daily Basis</h3>
                <p class="tip-details">Aloe Vera is not just for sunburns. It also helps in making the skin smooth, supple and younger-looking. While some use it as a toner or treatment, others swear by a daily swig and sip it in a juice.
                     You can simply apply Aloe Vera all over your face and neck, leave it on for 15 to 20 minutes and then rinse it off with plain water.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip" onclick="toggleTip(this)">
            <h3>3:Learn To Give Yourself A Massage With Oils</h3>
            <p class="tip-details">You might have heard that an Ayurvedic massage helps in managing stress, but did you know that it also boosts the radiance of your skin? Abhyanga, an ayurvedic massage done with warm oil not only moisturizes you deeply, but also gives you a radiant looking skin afterwards. When done regularly, it offers many health benefits. You can actually give a massage to yourself by working from your face down to the soles of your feet. 
                Even a two-minute massage before bed with a suitable oil can do wonders for your skin.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip" onclick="toggleTip(this)">
                <h3>4:To Cure Dry And Flaky Lips, Mix Sugar And Vaseline</h3>
                <p class="tip-details">Are you a self-proclaimed lipstick addict? If you don’t give your lips a treatment once in a while, do they look unhealthy? Do they look cracked and sore all the time? If yes, then you should definitely try this hack. Mix sugar and vaseline together and massage on your dried and tired lips. It works just like a lip scrub. 
                    Also, make sure you apply a natural lip balm on your lips at least once a day to provide your lips with a healthy dose of hydration.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip" onclick="toggleTip(this)">
                <h3>5:Do not forget the good old CTM</h3>
                <p class="tip-details">One common skin care regimen for all skin types is the popular CTM - Cleanse, Tone and Moisturize routine. Every morning and night, make sure you wash your face with a natural cleanser and then use a toner like Rose Water that is suitable for all skin types. 
                    In the morning, follow it up with a day cream and at night, follow it up with a night cream or a night serum.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip" onclick="toggleTip(this)">
                <h3>6:Eat Enough Vitamin C and Vitamin E</h3>
                <p class="tip-details">Vitamin C is rich in antioxidants, supports the immune system, helps blemishes heal properly and promotes radiant skin. Vitamin C is needed for the body to produce collagen which helps in strengthening the capillaries. Vitamin E protects from cell damage and supports skin growth. Foods high in vitamin C and vitamin E include oranges, papaya, strawberries, blueberries, broccoli, guava, almonds, avocados, hazelnuts, sunflower, beetroot and corn oils. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="tip" onclick="toggleTip(this)">
                <h3>7:Eat Plenty Of Zinc</h3>
                <p class="tip-details">Zinc in the body is responsible for the normal functioning of sebaceous glands in the skin, keeping skin soft and supple and repairing skin damage. Foods that are rich in Zinc include whole grains, seeds and nuts.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip" onclick="toggleTip(this)">
                <h3>8:Stay Hydrated</h3>
                <p class="tip-details">Dehydration makes your skin look dry, tired and slightly grey. It needs moisture to stay healthy and flexible. While all fluids count towards your daily intake, water is the best source of hydration. You should at least drink six to eight glasses of water a day.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip" onclick="toggleTip(this)">
                <h3>9: Replace Your Hair Towel With An Old T-shirt</h3>
                <p class="tip-details">Use a clean T-shirt instead of a regular towel to wrap my hair after you shower. Doing so can cut down frizziness and breakage. Try this simple hack to get softer, smoother and shinier hair.</p>
            <div class="tip" onclick="toggleTip(this)">
                <h3>10:Use a hair Protection Serum Before Using Your Hot Tools</h3>
                <p class="tip-details">Well, we all love our hair after a blowout or a heat styling session. We also know that excessive styling can do a number on our hair. No, I am not saying that we need to part with our hot tools totally, but we should make one adjustment to our routine when we are using heat to style hair. We should apply a protective products like heat-protecting serum or a spritz first before straightening, curling or blow-drying our hair.</p>
